# Image-Mapper
An easy to use image mapper that creates links on top of your image.

2) Left or Right click the image and drag your cursor over a section of the image you want to become a link. Then release.
3) Click on your highlighted area to change the URL of the link element.
4) Click the Generate HTML button to see what the HTML should look like.
5) Alter the HTML if you have any changes to make.
6) Click Update Demo to see the HTML in action. The Demo is created from the text in the textarea element. If you leave it empty, this button does nothing.
